# Monte Carlo Search Tree To Find Optimal Structure
This folder contains code written by Tsudalab of Tokyo University, check their Github page for reference: https://github.com/tsudalab/MDTS
Some import files:
* DB_16.py: file containing structure data in the shape of a string with 0 or 1, 0 for Si and 1 for Ge;
* test.py: Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm, output is an .npz file;
* result_analysis.ipynb: reads data from result.npz file, and plot better-so-far value plot;
* results_tree.ipynb: a dire attempt to plot a tree graph from the results.
